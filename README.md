# Exploratory-Data-Analysis-EDA-on-a-Public-Dataset
This project performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset using Python libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.

## 📊 Features
- Data cleaning and handling of missing values
- Distribution analysis (age, gender, survival)
- Visualizations (histogram, count plots, heatmap, boxplot)
- Correlation analysis

## 📁 Dataset
The dataset is loaded directly using Seaborn’s load_dataset('titanic').

## 🛠️ Requirements
See requirements.txt for all required packages.

## ▶️ How to Run
1. Clone the repo.
2. Install the required packages:  
   pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Open the notebook:  
   jupyter notebook titanic_eda.ipynb

## 📌 Output
Various plots and data insights showing age distribution, survival count, gender-based survival, and correlations.

## 📸 Sample Visuals
- Age distribution histogram
- Survival count by gender
- Correlation heatmap
